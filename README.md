Modification of a defunct printer carriage to use with testing accelerators  

The design used a deconstructed printer carriage to save on costs. The goal was to move a base on the carriage in a pure sinusoidal motion and be able to adjust the hertz for testing. This was accomplished but the range of motion of the carriage set the limit of how low the frequency range could go. 
The slider setup uses the 7.2v batter and voltage booster, a motor driver (L298N), and an Arduino for control. The printer carriage runs a dc motor powered by 12 volts.
